# GridCraft 🎨

A React-powered pixel art tool that lets you paint on a 14x14 grid with the full RGB color spectrum.

## Why GridCraft? 🎯

## Technical Implementation 🔧

- **React 18 (CDN)** - Loaded via unpkg, no build step required
- **In-Browser JSX Transpilation** - Babel Standalone converts JSX syntax to JavaScript at runtime
- **Component Architecture** - Modular design with seven specialized components:
  - `App.jsx` - Root component managing core state and download logic
  - `Grid.jsx` - Renders 14x14 grid and handles cell painting
  - `Tools.jsx` - Drawing tools (color picker, eraser, undo/redo, clear)
  - `Menu.jsx` - Download button and high-level controls
  - `Header.jsx` & `Footer.jsx` - Layout components
  - `main.jsx` - React entry point with `createRoot`
- **State Management** - React hooks for grid state, color selection, and undo/redo history
- **PNG Export System** - Multi-step process for high-quality exports:
  1. Temporarily removes grid borders and gaps for clean output
  2. Uses **html2canvas** with `scale: 8` for high-resolution captures
  3. Maintains transparent background with `backgroundColor: null`
  4. Restores original styling after capture
  5. Triggers download via dynamically created anchor tag
- **Undo/Redo System** - History tracking with `past`, `present`, `future` state pattern
- **Event Handling** - Mouse event listeners for right-click drawing
- **Props Communication** - Download function passed from App to Menu (`<Menu downloadImage={downloadImage} />`)

## Built With 🛠️

- **React 18** - UI library (loaded via CDN)
- **Babel Standalone** - In-browser JSX transpilation
- **html2canvas** - DOM-to-image capture library
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Core application logic
- **CSS3** - Grid layout, styling, and export-specific classes
- **HTML5** - Structure and download API
- **GitHub Pages** - Hosting and deployment

This project uses React loaded directly from a CDN rather than a build tool setup. This approach:
- Requires no build step or dependency installation
- Lightweight and portable
- Perfect for simple, focused applications
- All React features available via global `React` object
